Plugin Builder Results

Your plugin ${TemplateClass} was created in:
    ${PluginDir}

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    ${UserPluginDir}

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``${TemplateModuleName}.py``

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
